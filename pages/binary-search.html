            Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It
            works by
            repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, comparing the target value to the middle element of the
            interval, and then determining which half to search based on whether the target value is less than or
            greater than
            the middle element. This process continues until the target value is found or the search interval is empty,
            indicating that the target value is not present in the array.

        <h1>The Concept</h1>

        <h2>Divide and Rule</h2>
        <p>
            The "Divide and Rule" strategy, also known as "Divide and Conquer," is a fundamental algorithmic technique
            used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems. This approach involves
            dividing the problem into smaller, more manageable parts, solving each part independently, and then
            combining the solutions to form the final result. In the context of binary search, this method is employed
            by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty.
            This technique is efficient for problems where the solution can be constructed from solutions to smaller
            instances of the same problem.
        </p>

        <h2>Complexity</h2>
        <p>
            The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the
            array. This logarithmic complexity arises because each iteration of the binary search halves the search
            space, significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed to find the target value. As a result, binary
            search is highly efficient compared to linear search algorithms, especially for large datasets. The space
            complexity of binary search is O(1) in its iterative form, as it only requires a constant amount of
            additional memory for variables, regardless of the size of the input array.
